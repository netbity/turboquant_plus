# TurboQuant+ Experiments — Status and Findings

## Overview

TurboQuant v1 is complete: 4.6x KV cache compression at 99% of q8_0 speed across all context depths, with 1.1% PPL loss. These experiments explore improvements beyond the base paper.

## Experiment Status

### MERGED (in production)

| Experiment | Branch | Result |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| **Speed optimization** | `experiment/speed-optimization` | 739 → 2747 tok/s (3.72x speedup). fp16 WHT, half4 butterfly, graph-side rotation, block-32. |
| **Context scaling fix** | `experiment/context-scaling-fix` | Custom GGML_OP_TURBO_WHT + optimized dequant. Flat 99% of q8_0 through 32K context. |

### ACTIVE (promising, not yet merged)

#### Layer-Adaptive KV Cache
**Branch:** `experiment/layer-adaptive-extended-ctx`
**Finding:** The last 8 of 40 layers account for essentially ALL of turbo3's quality loss. **Verified 2K-32K context.**

| Config | 8-chunk PPL | vs q8_0 | 32-chunk PPL | vs q8_0 |
|--------|-------------|---------|--------------|---------|
| Uniform turbo3 | 6.211 | +1.6% | 5.471 | +1.0% |
| **Mode 2: q8_0 last 8** | **6.120** | **+0.14%** | **5.435** | **+0.37%** |

**Prefill:** Mode 2 matches or beats q8_0 at every context depth (0.99-1.02x). Faster than uniform turbo3 because 20% of layers use q8_0's cheaper dequant.

**Decode:** Mode 2 is 0.90-0.92x q8_0 (vs 0.86-0.90x for uniform turbo3). ~3% decode improvement from the q8_0 layers.

**Effective compression:** ~3.5x (vs 4.6x uniform, 2.0x q8_0). Trades ~25% compression for ~100% quality recovery.

**Status:** VERIFIED — ready to merge. See [extended benchmarks](experiment-layer-adaptive-extended.md) for full data.

#### Temporal Decay
**Branch:** `experiment/temporal-decay`
**Status:** Design complete, implementation pending.
**Idea:** Progressive requantization based on token age: recent tokens at 3.5-bit, old tokens at 2.5-bit or lower.

**Key design decisions (from research):**
- Best trigger: `llama_kv_cache::update()` — runs between batches, exclusive cache access
- Token age tracking: already exists in `llama_kv_cells` (pos per cell)
- MVP: 2 tiers (turbo3 → turbo2), check every 256 tokens
- Blocker: turbo2 block type doesn't exist yet

**Updated with layer-adaptive findings:** Temporal decay should be layer-aware. Early layers (insensitive) decay faster. Late layers (sensitive) decay slower or not at all. Combined with layer-adaptive mode 2, this means:
- Recent tokens: turbo3 everywhere (current behavior)
- Old tokens in layers 0-31: turbo2 (aggressive compression)
- Old tokens in layers 32-39: stay at turbo3 or q8_0 (preserve quality)

**Estimated impact:** 30-50% memory reduction for long-context workloads beyond what turbo3 already provides.

### BLOCKED (needs engineering work)

#### Asymmetric K/V Compression
**Branch:** `experiment/asymmetric-kv`
**Idea:** K at lower precision, V at higher — V carries content, K carries direction.

**Blocker:** Flash attention kernel template only has same-type instantiations. Mixed K/V types (e.g., turbo3 K + q8_0 V) need new template instantiations. Significant work for unclear payoff since uniform turbo3 already achieves 99% speed parity.

**Shipped fix:** V un-rotation now correctly checks `v->type` instead of `k->type`, which is needed for any future asymmetric support.

### DEAD (invalidated)

#### MoE-Aware Expert Gating
**Branch:** `experiment/moe-aware-gating`
**Idea:** Track expert firing frequency, give frequently-activated experts' KV higher precision.
**Why it's dead:** Expert routing is an FFN signal. KV cache stores attention projections computed BEFORE expert routing. K and V values are identical regardless of which experts fire. The premise doesn't apply to KV cache compression.

Codex independently reached the same conclusion: "Expert routing is an FFN signal; KV cache importance is an attention signal. The premise may not map cleanly."

### NOT YET STARTED

#### Rotation-Free via Outlier Channeling (Idea E from notes)
**Potential:** Highest single improvement if viable. Eliminates WHT rotation entirely by isolating outlier channels at fp16 and quantizing the rest without rotation.
**Test:** One-line kurtosis measurement on real KV tensors with top-k outlier channels removed. If kurtosis drops to ~3.0 without rotation, the approach works.
**Status:** Not started. The dequant is now fast enough that eliminating rotation may not be the highest priority.

#### Fused Compressed Attention (Priority 6 from notes)
**Potential:** Compute Q·K dot products directly on quantized indices without full dequant. Precompute Q·centroid table (8 values), then each K element is a table lookup instead of centroid lookup + multiply.
**Status:** Deferred. The optimized dequant closed most of the gap. This would help decode speed at very long context but is complex (custom flash attention kernel).

#### Speculative Cache Warming (Idea B from notes)
**Status:** Skip. Codex and the Obsidian notes analysis both recommend against — complexity doesn't justify marginal gains.

#### Codebook Interpolation (Idea C from notes)
**Status:** Skip. Soft assignment (storing interpolation weights) costs more bits than the quality improvement justifies. Compression theory agrees.

## Key Learnings

1. **Layer sensitivity is extremely non-uniform.** The last 20% of layers account for ~100% of turbo3's quality loss. This is the single most important finding for future work.

2. **Dequant compute, not rotation, is the real bottleneck.** The graph-side WHT rotation (whether dense matmul or custom O(d log d) op) adds <1% overhead. The per-position centroid lookup in flash attention is what scales with context.

3. **Byte-level optimization matters on GPU.** Reading the same qs/signs bytes once per 4 elements instead of per-element eliminated the context scaling regression. GPU constant memory access patterns dominate.

4. **WHT and RoPE don't commute — but it doesn't matter.** Graph-side WHT applied after RoPE (same pipeline point as KV quantize) works correctly. The earlier failure was a matrix orientation bug, not a commutativity issue.

5. **MoE expert routing is irrelevant for KV cache.** KV vectors are computed in shared attention before expert routing. Don't waste time on MoE-aware KV compression.

6. **Always run perplexity.** "Coherent text" evaluation caught nothing when PPL was 165. Speed numbers are meaningless without quality validation.

## Recommended Next Steps (Priority Order)

1. ~~**Test layer-adaptive at extended contexts**~~ — ✅ DONE. Mode 2 holds 2K-32K, +0.14-0.37% PPL.
2. **Implement turbo2 for temporal decay** — 2-bit block type, the blocker for temporal decay MVP
3. **Rotation-free kurtosis test** — one measurement to determine if Idea E is viable
4. **Upstream PR preparation** — llama.cpp CONTRIBUTING.md requires perplexity, KL divergence, and CPU perf baselines
