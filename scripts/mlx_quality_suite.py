    "The development of the transistor at Bell Labs in 1947 marked the beginning "

    "Brattain demonstrated that a solid-state device could amplify electrical "
    "signals, replacing bulky vacuum tubes. By 1958, Jack Kilby at Texas "
    "Instruments had created the first integrated circuit, combining multiple "
    "transistors on a single germanium chip. Robert Noyce independently developed "
    "a silicon-based version at Fairchild Semiconductor, which proved more "
    "practical for mass production. Gordon Moore observed in 1965 that the number "
    "of transistors on a chip doubled approximately every two years, a prediction "
    "that held remarkably well for over five decades. Modern processors contain "
    "billions of transistors etched at scales of just a few nanometers, pushing "
    "against fundamental physical limits. Quantum tunneling effects become "
    "significant below about 5 nanometers, forcing engineers to explore novel "
    "architectures including gate-all-around transistors and chiplet designs. "
    "The industry continues to find ways to extend performance through packaging "
    "innovations, heterogeneous integration, and specialized accelerators for "
    "tasks like machine learning inference. The original transistor that started "
    "it all now sits in the Smithsonian Institution.\n\n"
    "The history of cryptography stretches back thousands of years, from simple "
    "substitution ciphers used by Julius Caesar to the sophisticated public-key "
    "systems that protect modern internet communications. The Enigma machine, "
    "used by Nazi Germany during World War Two, employed a series of rotating "
    "electrical rotors to create a cipher with an astronomical number of possible "
    "settings. Breaking Enigma required the combined efforts of Polish and British "
    "mathematicians, most notably Alan Turing at Bletchley Park, who designed "
    "electromechanical devices called bombes to systematically test key settings. "
    "The success of this effort shortened the war by an estimated two years and "
    "saved millions of lives. After the war, Claude Shannon published his "
    "groundbreaking paper on communication theory, establishing the mathematical "
    "foundations of information theory and proving that a one-time pad provides "
    "perfect secrecy. The invention of public-key cryptography by Diffie and "
    "Hellman in 1976 revolutionized the field by allowing two parties to establish "
    "a shared secret over an insecure channel without any prior arrangement. "
    "Today, RSA and elliptic curve cryptography protect trillions of dollars in "
    "daily electronic transactions, while quantum computing threatens to upend "
